**Marketing Manager. Newtown Science Festival. Oct 2021 - Sep 2022.**

Newtown Science Festival was a project started by a PhD student from Lancaster University and myself to give an opportunity to universities from Wales and England to visit rural areas of Wales such as Newtown. We created a 1-day festival open to all the family and completely free to learn about science careers and experiments.
During my role as Marketing Manager, I had to be in charge of all the marketing for the festival, including the creation of strategies, copywriting, design and photography of the project. This allowed me to become an independent worker as well as be able to accomplish deadlines for funding applications and arrange all the digital marketing strategies according to our different personas. 
We had a total of 12 universities visiting including Lancaster University and 5 companies with more than 400 visitors during the day. 
In the feedback collected more than 85% of the visitors wished the event to happen again next year.
